        <p>This is me, born in May of 1998 and is now currently 26 years old.</p>
        <p>I am currently learning programming at freeCodeCamp, a very suitable self-learning website for anyone who aspires to be a programmer.</p>
        <code><p>This is where you can learn coding for free! <a href="freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a></p></code>
        <ul>
          <li>freeCodeCamp - a place of paradise for programming aspirants that are sick of scam from educational organizations who only teaches basics (not even everything) in all yours years studying</li>
          <li>I just really don't have anything to say here, so I'll just advertise freeCodeCamp, my alma-matter!</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="My_Parents">
        <header class="bold">My Parents</header>
        <p><span class="bold">Nelson Cawie</span> - a pastor, a very humble and loving husband and father to us. He barely get's mad, and he's an easygoing person that all of us siblings are so close to.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Rosalia Cawie</span> - a strick mother, but all her strictness is for our own goodness. She's like a dragon that instead of running away from her, you will instead be drawn to her. Always expreses her love to all of us, she's the best mother there is!</p>
        <code>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord! (Joshua 24:15)</code>
        <ul>
          <li>We were born in Mindanao but because of my father's profession, we transferred to Luzon when I was around 7 years old.</li>
          <li>When I was 12 years old, we moved to Visayas and stayed here (until present, I already have a wife even) for 12 years now. My parents moved back to our hometown and continued the ministry there.</li>
        </ul>

        <header class="bold">My First Job</header>
        <p>iQor - although this is not really my first job, but this is where I was awaken to the cruelty of society. I've seen a lot of so called "educated" person, by degree only, of course, that are my workmate in this company. I, who have not graduated, is earning the same wage as those who took time to study 4 years, all for what? NOTHING!
        </p>
        <p>This is a private company, but the corruption is all in the air. Bosses stealing their subordinate's time, unpaid overtime, and kissing asses, all can be seen here (not only here, but in all corporate companies)!</p>
        <code>Boycot all underpaying Jobs! Char!</code>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a BPO campany.</li>
          <li>Landing place of all people after finishing their so called degrees!</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="My_Wife">
        <header class="bold">My Wife</header>
        <p><span class="bold">Frincess Viterbo</span> - my wife whom I met in my first BPO job. We've been together for 4 years as boyfrined/girlfriend, and last year, August 20, 2023, which is also her 25th birthday, we got married. She was also about 6-7 months pregnant by then.</p>
        <p>I guess there's something good you get from working in a BPO company. Lol!</p>
        <code>BPO - where you can either meet your life-partner or your mistress! A place of disaster for all relastionship. LMFAO!</code>
        <ul>
          <li>She's a graduate of Education, a degree holder and a licensed teacher, but is currently being a full-time mom.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Finally, we are here! Let me introduce my firstborn <span class="drum">*drumroll*</span> - <span class="bold">Kaleb Zekaria Cawie</span> - my son!</p>
        <p>He's my everything, the reason why I started pursuing my aspirant as a programmer, more seriously. I want to earn more- by being a developer for Web3 because that's where all the money is!</p>
        <code>Web3 is the Future!</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Crypto - a place worse than any casino. You will either earn something or lose everything, no in-between!</li>
